Important notes:
1. IN CASE OF DGRAM with AF_UNIX in order to sendto some sockaddr struct, that sockaddr struct needs to be bound using bind.
    so if you want to send to client from server also client needs to be bound, so you bind both client and server.
    if you didn`t bind client, you can send to server (server is bound) but when you try to send from server, tou get error ENOTCONN.
    as you bind both client and server, linux will create file for both , the pathes need to be different.
2. IN CASE OF DGRAM with AF_INET, you send by ip address, so no kernel bind for client is required, so you need to only bind server, to get
    the data over it along side with the sender`s address then resend over that address and the client will recieve it.
3. SERVER: socket -> bind -> receive_from (gets client bound address)-> sendto (cleint address)
    CLIENT(have server address): socket ->bind ->  sendto(server know address) -> receive_from (any)
