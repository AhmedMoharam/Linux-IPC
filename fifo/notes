Important notes:
1. open() is a blocking command when opening a FIFO. it can be unblocking by O_NONBLOCK.
    opening a FIFO is blocking untill the fifo is opened from a process A for read and process B for write.
2. when fifo descriptor is closed using close() the process that reads from the fifo will recieve EOF
    hence read() will return 0.
3. when calling read() with huge count, it will try to read that count untill it gets EOF.
4. FIFO is created using mkfifo().
5. FIFO is deleted from fs using unlink.
