Important notes:
1. in case of  closing client socket file decriptor,then reading from server:
    read will be nonblocking and read cnt is zero which means EOF.
    so you should close that client file descriptor, or never read from it.
2. select() could be used to capture if there is available data to be read on a fd inside fd_set
    i.e read will be non-blocking on the FD_ISSET on the corresponding fd.
    also on the above case select will return and the closed client fd will be TRUE FD_ISSET
    since read on it is nonblocking.
